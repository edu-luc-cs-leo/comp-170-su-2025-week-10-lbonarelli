Looking back at this course, I feel like I’ve learned a lot being my first coding class taken at Loyola, but not just about Python but about how to think through problems in a more structured and logical way. At the beginning of the summer, I was still building my confidence with code. I was making things work, but not always in the cleanest or most efficient way. I had never taken a proper coding class before so you could understand my nervousness and stress of having to successfully do well in a class I knew nothing about. Through the weekly assignments and especially the posted solutions, I started understanding how to improve clarity, add flexibility to functions, and optimize my code without making it unreadable.
I made a consistent effort to show up on time and be present for class. The days that I did not attend wer either because of emergencies I had especially at the beginning of summer where I talked about it with the Professor. There were moments where I felt really focused and engaged, and I tried to stay off distractions while we worked, but I felt like I could’ve asked more questions in class in order to interact more with the class itself and Professor Irakliotis as well. I also helped a classmate early in the course who wasn’t sure how to properly add comments to their code. I had already figured that part out, so I showed them how I write mine and helped them make theirs more readable and consistent. This felt good because since I had never done a lot of coding in the past, getting to explain this to another person in a topic which I am not familiar at all, made me feel incredible. 
There were two assignments I turned in late, and I want to be honest about why. At the start of the summer, someone really close to me passed away in my family. It happened suddenly and hit me hard. It definitely affected my focus and energy early on, especially during that first week or two. I informed Professor Irakliotis. I tried my best to stay on top of the work, but I know it set me back a little as well as now in the last week where legal proceedings are still being consistent in my country. Still, I kept pushing and made sure to complete everything else as best as I could once I was back in a more stable place.
Throughout the course, I can say with confidence that I’ve grown in how I write and approach code. I’ve started testing my functions more regularly and making sure they don’t just work but make sense to someone else reading them. I still have a lot of room to improve, but I can tell I’ve made progress and that I learned from my mistakes and tried to reflect on posted solutions to see what I could take from them.
Based on my above reflection, I propose B as my final grade.
