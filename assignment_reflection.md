For the last assignment in COMP 170, I wrote a recursive function in order to calculate the sum of the digits of a number. My version worked as expected for base 10 and I got to do it correctly by using a basic structure as well as having a clear base case and a return statement that added the last digit to the recursive call on the rest of the number. After writing my code, I went on to look at Professor Irakliotis posted solutions and I was able to notice some things I could’ve done better. 
I would say that the first posted version was pretty close to what I wrote, but in my head I could see it had better comments as well as a helpful docstring that explained what the function does. The posted solution also included support for different number bases, which I didn’t think to include ever but I guess as a beginner to intermediate level of coding it might happen. This was a good reminder to make my code more flexible whenever possible.
The second and third versions I noticed focused more on code optimization. The second version of the code simplified things by removing extra variables and combining steps. This for me made the code cleaner without being hard to follow. The third version used a one liner with a ternary operator to do everything in a single return statement. I hadn’t written it that way in my own code, but seeing this approach helped me understand how to write more concise and efficient code.
One thing I did miss in my code for this assignment was adding test cases with expected outputs. The posted solutions had quick tests at the bottom that printed results and showed what to expect. That’s something I’ll definitely try to include moving forward, since it’s an easy way to check if my function works right.
In general, this assignment helped me see the difference between just getting code to work and writing it in a cleaner, more flexible, and more professional way. I was satisfied with what I wrote, but still missing a lot to get better.
